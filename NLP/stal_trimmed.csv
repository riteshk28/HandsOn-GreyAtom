Hello Martin,

I?ve had a look on Google Street View to check out 2-12 Halls Road and they look like there were probably built during the 1960-70s. Would we have any records relating to the change of number. I assume it would have happened when the infill housing occurred.

Hi

I was wondering if anyone else is having a problem with logging in to the new remote system first time? For at least the last 6 log ins I have had to attempt it twice ? the first time it doesn?t work and I get an error message saying I?m not authorised, then I get a voicemail notification though the voicemail has nothing on it, then I try again and it works.

It?s very annoying having to do it twice and also having to clear my voicemail each time!

Hi

When I click on a couple of shortcuts on desk top to external websites I get the following message
